## Load packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

## Github operations
```{r}
library(usethis)
library(gitcreds)
use_git_config(user.name = "dle79", user.email = "dle79@calpoly.edu")
create_github_token()
gitcreds_set()
git_sitrep()
```

## Read in data
```{r}
age <- read.csv(here::here("final-project", "median_age_years.csv"))
health <- read.csv(here::here("final-project", "total_health_spending_per_person_us.csv"))
```
We will be using the two quantitative variables Total health spending per person in USD and median age.

Our response variable will be Total health spending / person USD which can be described as the average amount spent per person in USD for every country from 1994 to 2009 according to the World Health Organization.

Our observational variable will be the median age of the total population in each country since 1949. It also includes predicted median age until 2099.

We expect the relationship between average spending per person and median age to be positive because as the population becomes increasingly older on average, people will require more medical attention. We would also expect both the total health spending per person and the median age to increase with time.

For our age dataset, there was no cleaning required as there were no missing values or outlying values. All that was required for this data set was a pivot and then a merge with the health data set. 

## Pivot and Clean Data
```{r}
age_long <- age |>
  pivot_longer(cols = X1949:X2099,
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "median_age") |>
  mutate(year = as.integer(str_sub(year, 2)))

health_long <- health |>
  pivot_longer(cols = X1994:X2009,
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "healthCost") |>
  mutate(year = as.integer(str_sub(year, 2)))
```
Because the variable name started with a number, "X" was added before each year automatically by R. As a consequence, the year was changed into a categorical variable. Thus, after pivoting, I removed the "X" from each year and converted it into an integer.

Otherwise, no other data needed to be cleaned here.

## Join data
```{r}
ageHealth <- health_long |>
  left_join(age_long, by = c("country", "year"))
```
We decided to perform a left join between health_long and age_long, since the total health spending has less observation, and in turn, decrease the amount of missing values.


## 2.1 Data Visualization Part One
```{r}
ageHealth |>
  ggplot(aes(y=healthCost,
             x=median_age)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.25, height = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Total Health Spending vs. Median Age From 1994-2009",
       subtitle = "Health Spending",
       x = "Median Age",
       y = "") +
  theme_bw()
```
Based on the scatter plot above, our assumption was correct and there does appear to be a positive correlation between amount spent on health and median age. As the median age increases, the average amount spent on health does as well. Although the correlation appears to be positive, it does not appear linear.

## 2.1 Data Visualization Part Two
```{r}
ageHealth |>
  ggplot(aes(y=healthCost,
             x=median_age,
             color=year)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.25, height = 0.5) + 
  labs(title = "Total Health Spending vs. Median Age From 1994-2009",
       subtitle = "Health Spending",
       x = "Median Age",
       y = "",
       color = "Year:") +
  theme_bw()
```
After coloring by year, we can see that within each of the shades of blue, the correlation appears to be pretty similar, so the relationship between amount spent on health and median age has not changed much form 1994-2009. 


## Fitting a Simple Linear Model (Part 2.2)
```{r}
model <- lm(healthCost ~ median_age,
            data = ageHealth)

```
We are fitting a linear relationship using median age to predict total health spending per person. So the x variable is median age and the y variable is total health spending.
```{r}
library(broom)
tidy(model)
augment(model) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = median_age, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_jitter()
```
Model:
total health spending / person = -1745 + 95.4(median age)

For every one year increase in median age, there is a 95.4 USD increase in total health spending per person.
